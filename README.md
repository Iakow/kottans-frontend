# Kottans-frontend course

## Git intro

I've been familiar with git for a long time, but very superficially: limiting itself to the basic set of commands, and within the repository for one developer. I've tried branches just to be able to do it. I have long wanted to understand deeper. But with limited time, you have to choose. I am very glad that such an opportunity finally fell out.

Two ideas that interest me as a result:

1. Learn to use the git to monitor progress on my training projects.
2. Accordingly, highlight small goals in the work so that the history of the commits is clear and understandable.

## Linux CLI, and HTTP

I have been a happy user of Ubuntu for a long time, so nothing new except that dubious printer stuff :)

As a person who wants to know everything, I certainly studied the topic of HTTP, and now I have repeated it. But without practical use, this knowledge does not linger in my head...

## Git Collaboration

Wow, doing the PR turned out to be not at all what I thought. The scheme of working in a local repository with two remote branches (forked origin and upstream) is something new for me. Although, this is logical given what has been learned. Now I can contribute to open source! 
It remains only to find out who I want to help... 	&#129300;

## Intro to HTML and CSS

Basically, all the information was already familiar to me, so the courses were taken in fast forward mode. Except for grids, I'm glad to finally touch them. It looks like a very powerful thing.

## Responsive Web Design

It turned out that until now I have never used the order property in flexbox. Either I didnâ€™t know about it, or I forgot.

Also, it was news to me that there are responsive patterns and they have names: Column Drop, Mostly Fluid, Layout Shifter and Off Canvas. I used only the first of them, which, apparently, corresponds to the level of my development ))
